## 📁 Files Needed

Just upload these files to Netlify:
- ✅ `index-simple.html` (rename to `index.html` or use netlify.toml)
- ✅ `app.js`
- ✅ `netlify.toml` (for redirects)

That's it! No PHP, no database, no server!

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Login**: Just enter your name (stored in browser)
2. **Predict**: Select top 3 drivers for each race
3. **Leaderboard**: See everyone's points
4. **Data**: Everything stored in browser's localStorage

## 📝 Notes

- **Data is local** - Each browser stores its own data
- **No backend** - Pure frontend JavaScript
- **Simple** - Perfect for small groups/friends
- **Fast** - No server requests, instant loading

## 🔄 To Make It Shared (Optional)

If you want shared leaderboard across all users, you'd need:
- A backend (PHP, Node.js, etc.)
- Or use a service like Firebase/Supabase (free tier)

But for friends/colleagues, this simple version works great!

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Rename file:**
   - `index-simple.html` → `index.html`
   - Or keep `netlify.toml` as is

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Drag folder to Netlify
   - Or connect GitHub repo

3. **Share the link:**
   - Netlify gives you: `yourname.netlify.app`
   - Share with friends!

## ✅ That's It!

Your F1 Fantasy app is live on Netlify - **simple, fast, and free!**

FORCE REBUILD MARKER
====================

Timestamp: 2026-01-30 10:51:00 UTC
Purpose: Force Railway to rebuild with latest code

This file exists to trigger a rebuild on Railway.
Railway should detect this change and rebuild the application.

The config.php file has been updated to:
- Use environment variables for database connection
- Force TCP for remote connections (prevents socket errors)
- Provide better error messages

If you're seeing this file, Railway should rebuild automatically.
If not, manually trigger a redeploy in Railway dashboard.

Expected Environment Variables on Railway:
- RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_DOMAIN (database host)
- RAILWAY_TCP_PROXY_PORT (database port)  
- MYSQLUSER (database user)
- MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD (database password)
- MYSQL_DATABASE (database name)

Check Railway dashboard under "Variables" to ensure these are set.
